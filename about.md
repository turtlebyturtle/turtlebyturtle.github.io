welcome to my blog!

this site is a collection of various semi-useful content stemming from my various hyperfixations. as of late i'm spending a lot of time thinking about urbanism, with a particular focus on the region of greater montreal.

### a little bit about me
i am turtle (he/they, not my real name), the sole writer for this "blog". i am constantly jumping between a thousand different personal projects, so i apologise if i neglect this site for a while.

i created this site so i would have a dedicated place to vomit out all the random stuff i learn throughout my research. my friends, as lovely and patient as they are, can only handle so much information about street signs in montreal.

please note that i am not an expert in any of the topics i cover. if ever i make a mistake, please reach out to me and let me know so i can correct it. also, feel free to contact me if you think there's information i could add to a post.

### style
i generally write in canadian english, but i hang out with a lot of americans and brits, so please forgive me if those dialects slip into my writing.

my articles are not written in lowercase, it's just a stylistic choice for the meta stuff.
