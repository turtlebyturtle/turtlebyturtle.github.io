As part of my journey to expand my knowledge about the geography of the Island of Montreal, I've been playing a lot of OpenGuessr (my preferred alternative to GeoGuessr). In the many rounds I had played, I noticed that a helpful tool to narrow down boroughs was the humble street sign. While I was obviously aware—and I'm sure you are too—of their utility in conveying the street name, I was begining to notice just how different they are in some areas. I had assumed that the city just used the same rose design everywhere (which, to be fair, is used in nearly half the boroughs), but I was quickly proven wrong. In fact, even when a borough does use the "generic" design, there are still exceptions, as many older signs have yet to be replaced.

I went looking for more information on this (admittedly niche) topic, I found very little, so I started taking notes. A few days later I had a fairly complete list of the signs used on the island. I probably missed some, so I'll continue to update this post as I collect more information.

Please note that all images were taken from Google Street View, but I will try to replace them with my own as over time.
